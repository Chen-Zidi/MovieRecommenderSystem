Recommendation System are divided into following categories:
- Content-based: recommend items similar to the ones that the user like in the past (a lot of unstructured data, price, item info... many features, high latency)
- Collaborative filtering: recommend to the active use the items that other users with simiar tastes like in the past (most important, low latency, no unstructured data)
- Demographic: recommend based on the demographic profile of the user
- Knowledge-based (consulting, specific domain knowledge)
- Community-based (preference of users friends)
- Hybrid recommender systems (combination of above methods)
